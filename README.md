# webscraper
Here is a demo of my webscraper project that I made in Python using BeautifulSoup4. It scrapes book data from books.toscrape.com. Enabled users to select a genre and navigate through multiple pages within that genre, handling invalid page numbers gracefully. Included functionality to return to the home screen at any point during use.
