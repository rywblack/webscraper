# webscraper
Here is a demo of my webscraper project that I made in Python using BeautifulSoup4. It scrapes https://books.toscrape.com, and allows the user to select a genre and lists the books contained in that genre. When a genre has multiple pages it allows the user to flip through each page, and discards invalid page numbers. It also also the user to return to the home screen at any time.
